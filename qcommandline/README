The version included in pcmanfm-qt is 0.3.0 downloaded from:
http://xf.iksaif.net/dev/qcommandline/qcommandline-0.3.0.tar.bz2

To make it usable and compilable with pcmanfm-qt, we made some changes.
We modified its source code to replace Qt specific keywords with macros.
* signals => Q_SIGNALS
* emit => Q_EMIT
* forearch => Q_FOREACH

Besides, we add #include "qcommandline.moc" in qcommandline.cpp.
